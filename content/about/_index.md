![Me.][1]

I am a software developer with a passion for real-time graphics, simulation and systems programming.
My roots are in video games technology, but I have also worked in DCCs and production rendering.

My interests cover a broad spectrum - while my professional career has been mostly focused on realtime graphics, I have dabbled in audio programming, networking, asset pipelines and content tools, UI programming, scripting...
I have experience in systems level programming on Windows, MacOS and Linux, but also web technologies such as WebGL, RESTful APIs and Websockets and an occasional stint with console development.

I especially enjoy figuring out how complex systems can interact to create even richer applications, as well as working on the full stack - from low level performance optimizations, all the way to user facing tools and UX development.
