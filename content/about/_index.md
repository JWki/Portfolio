I am an enthusiast when it comes to game engine technology and computer graphics.
My interests cover the whole spectrum of systems commonly found in video games technology - memory management, work scheduling, resource streaming, networking, asset pipelines, world editing tools, rendering, object models, UI and scripting - I am fascinated by everything that makes modern video games run. My focus lies in the realm of rendering, however I am actively looking to broaden my capabilities at all times.

Beyond every individual aspect of game technology, I love figuring out how all of these systems play together to form a coherent whole. Empowering artists and designers to be able to achieve their vision without being limited by technology and with minimum friction, to me, is the ultimate goal of game engine technology, and wanting to create this technology is what drives me in my programming career.
