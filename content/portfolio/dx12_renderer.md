No better way to learn a new graphics API than to use it!

*Yep, that's the Qt text editor example hosting a D3D12 renderer.* 

Not a lot to say about this one really - my first real foray into D3D12 after having used D3D11 and OpenGL before that.
Part of a greater vision - as always - this basically ended up being a tiny little D3D12 renderer with physically based material rendering (you gotta have it!) and sunlight shadows (single cascade). I also ended up playing with an out-of-process editor using Qt instead of my beloved [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with communication being done over web sockets.

*A more proper UI in Qt, running in a separate process to the renderer.* 

Also my first time dealing with GLTF model / scene files - I used a custom binary format for models but wrote an importing pipeline for GLTF this time to see how it is. I am yet undecided how much I like the format, I have a few issues with it but it's fine as an exchange format I guess.
